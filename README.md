## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a master craftsman from Silas's grandfather's era visits the modern Works. What does he praise? What does he mourn?
- Draft a letter from Mr. Corvus to his New York partners, analyzing Silas Thorne not as a businessman, but as a psychological phenomenon.
- Create a monologue for Alistair Finch, the secretary, revealing his private thoughts on the 'symphony' of the Works versus the 'silence' of the ledger.
- Imagine a chapter from the perspective of the Bessemer converter itself. What does it 'feel'? What does it 'want'?

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a dynamic webpage that simulates the financial and production trade-offs between Bessemer and Open-Hearth processes, using the novel's data.
- Create an audio composition that layers the industrial sounds described (steam-hammer, converter pour) with readings of philosophical texts from the era (Spencer, Aurelius).
